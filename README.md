# sot-qp-dsl
New SoT/QP DSL

# Idea
I had to delete and completely redo the original qp-dsl. The reason is quite simple: the original
language and its concepts wouldn't work well with the common constriant representation. Furthermore, 
the way I did it was a nightmare for code/text generation. This is going to be cleaner, easier to 
generate, and above all compliant to CCR.
